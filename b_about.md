Hi everyone,

My name is Jo√£o Ramos and I am a student at the University of Porto pursuing a Computer Science major. I will be graduating next July. I have been interested in algorithms and data structures since High School and I have competed in various competitive programming contests such as the International Olympiads in Informatics, CIIC (Ibero-American competition, where I won a silver medal), MIUP (National ACM contest, where my team won 1st place in the last two years) and SWERC (Regional ACM Contest). Also, I will be interning at Facebook (Menlo Park) next summer.
