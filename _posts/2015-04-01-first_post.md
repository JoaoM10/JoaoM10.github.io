I will use my personal blog to write about algorithms and data structures, not only
"tutorial" articles but mostly editorials for some problems I find especially interesting.

As other of my hobbies is security, you will be able to find here some CTF write-up's.

And finally, do not be surprised if I write about number theory too.
